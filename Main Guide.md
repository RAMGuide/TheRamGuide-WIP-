# The Ram Guide
This is a guide designed to teach you the basics of DRAM from both theoretical and practical standpoints. In this guide, we aim to cover topics such as the mechanics of DRAM, common implementations of DRAM in computer systems and DRAM overclocking.


# Memory Timings

# Primary Timings

# tAA (Cas latency)

# tCWL

# tRCD

# tRP

# tRAS

# tRC

# Subtimings 

# tCCD

Comomnly spilt into tRDRD and tWRWR timings.

# Tertiary timings

Tertiary timings are platform specific timings that dictate delay between read and write operations. Thus including read to read, read to write, write to read and write to write.
