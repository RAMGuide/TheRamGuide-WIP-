## Stats
- For checking current timings and subtimings on [Ryzen](https://zentimings.protonrom.com/) and on [Intel](https://asrock-timing-configurator.software.informer.com/download/)
- General software for checking various settings (not that detailed for memory)--[CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)
- Great program for checking temperatures, voltages, and settings alike--[Hwinfo](https://www.hwinfo.com/download.php)
## Stress Testing

- [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) 800k (FFT size) + [Aida 64 Cache](https://www.aida64.com/downloads) -- simultaneously
- [TM5](http://testmem.tz.ru/tm5.rar) (Rar file, so need to change it to .zip) with [anta77 extreme profile](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uegPn9ZuUoWxOssCP4PjMjGW9eC_1VJA/) -- Basic is 3 cycles (~1.5h for 16GB of memory) but can modify it to be however long you want.
- [OCCT testing](https://www.ocbase.com/) -- AVX2 (CPU+RAM) + SSE (Hits FCLK a fair bit, but Random-x is a lot faster)
- [MemTest (not x86)](https://hcidesign.com/memtest/) -- Open up a couple installations each with ~2000 MBs allocated:
- [Random-x](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX) -- For FCLK testing on Ryzen. Boot up and listen for crackling to determine instability.
